# Changelog

## 2026-05-18 — Plan command and API tokens

### Added
- **`/plan <duration> [description]`** slash command for forecasting effort per issue. Creates an entry in the new `plan_entries` table; re-running on the same issue supersedes the previous plan via the same chain pattern as `/correct`. Confirmation comment names the plan ID.
- **`/unplan`** slash command soft-deletes the active plan on an issue, recording the closing comment as a paired reference.
- **`plan_entries`** Postgres table: same shape as `time_entries` without `client_id`, plus closing-comment columns. A partial unique index enforces at most one active plan per `(repository, issue_number)`.
- **`api_tokens`** Postgres table: bearer tokens hashed with bcrypt (cost 12), prefix-indexed for the admin listing, never physically deleted.
- **Bearer-token middleware** on `/api/v1/*` accepting `Authorization: Bearer bb_...`. Reuses the existing session-cookie path; both produce the same handler context. Token requests re-check ALLOWED_ORGS membership against the GitHub API via the App's installation tokens, cached per user for 5 minutes.
- **REST API endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/v1/plans`, `GET /api/v1/plans/{id}`, `GET /api/v1/plans/{id}/chain`
  - `GET /api/v1/issues/{owner}/{repo}/{number}/plan-vs-actual`
  - `GET /api/v1/tokens`, `POST /api/v1/tokens`, `DELETE /api/v1/tokens/{id}`
- **Admin panel**: new **Plans** page (per-issue active plan, planned vs logged minutes, variance, status badge) with a per-issue plan-history view. New **API tokens** page (create / list / revoke; plaintext shown exactly once at creation).
- **CLI wrapper** (`bin/billbird`) gains `plan` and `unplan` verbs.
- **Docs**: `docs/api-tokens.md` (lifecycle, format, example, security model); `docs/commands.md` describes `/plan` and `/unplan`; `docs/architecture.md` records the two new internal packages.

### Changed
- `/api/v1/*` now requires authentication (cookie or bearer). Previously all `/api/v1/*` routes were open — this brings the API surface up to the rest of the application's auth posture.
- `internal/webhook.NewHandler` takes a `*planentry.Store`; `internal/admin.NewHandler` and `internal/api.NewHandler` take `*planentry.Store` and `*apitoken.Store`. Callers in `cmd/billbird/main.go` need updating to match.

### Schema migrations
- `000007_create_plan_entries` — new table with `plan_status` enum and the partial unique index.
- `000008_create_api_tokens` — new table for bearer-token storage and audit fields.

### Integration tests
- Added `internal/integration` (build tag `integration`) with eight tests that exercise the new code paths against a real Postgres spun up via `embedded-postgres`. Covered: migrations apply on an empty database, partial unique index rejects duplicate active plans, supersede chain walks both directions, plan-vs-actual classifier against real data, token generate / verify / revoke, last-used throttle, bearer middleware over HTTP including ex-member rejection. Run with `go test -tags=integration ./internal/integration/...`.
- Refactor: `APIAuthDependencies.Membership` is now the `MembershipPolicy` interface (`IsAllowed(username) bool`); tests pass a deterministic fake.
- `db.MigrateFrom(databaseURL, sourceURL)` added so tests can apply migrations from an absolute file:// URL independent of CWD; `db.Migrate(databaseURL)` continues to use the default `file://migrations`.

### Dev helpers and smoke harness
- `cmd/smokeseed` — one-shot binary that inserts a bearer token and a sample plan against a running Billbird database. Prints the plaintext token to stdout. Intended for local smoke runs only. `DATABASE_URL=... go run ./cmd/smokeseed`.
- `BILLBIRD_DEV_MEMBERSHIP_BYPASS=true` — main.go honours this dev-only env var to short-circuit the GitHub org membership check, so a local smoke run does not require a registered GitHub App. The startup banner prints a loud warning. Documented in `docs/configuration.md` as not-for-production.
- Live smoke verified on 2026-05-20: started Postgres → ran the binary against it → migrations applied → seeded token + plan → curled `/api/v1/plans` and `/api/v1/issues/.../plan-vs-actual` end to end → 200 with the seeded plan; without auth → 401; with bogus token → 401; with valid token but bypass off → 401 (membership check refused, correct security behaviour).

## 2026-04-12 — REST API, OAuth, admin panel, org-gated auth, CLI wrapper

### Added
- **REST API** (`internal/api`): Full JSON API under `/api/v1/` — time entries (list with filters, get single, correction chain), clients CRUD, label mappings CRUD, CSV export
- **GitHub OAuth** (`internal/auth`): OAuth flow, org membership check against `ALLOWED_ORGS`, signed session cookies, `RequireAuth` middleware
- **Admin panel** (`internal/admin`): HTMX dashboard with hours overview (stats + filterable entries table), client management (add/activate/deactivate), label mapping management (add/remove), all consuming REST API via internal calls
- **Org-gated authorization**: Slash commands (`/log`, `/correct`, `/delete`) now require the commenter to be a member of one of the `ALLOWED_ORGS`. Non-members get an error comment. Replaces old `ADMIN_ORG_NAME` single-org config.
- **CLI wrapper** (`bin/billbird`): Shell script for terminal-based time logging via `gh`. Auto-detects repo from git remote. Tested against MWest2020/Billbird#1.
- **Templates** (`templates/`): layout, dashboard, entries table, clients, clients table, mappings, mappings table — all with HTMX partial updates

### Changed
- `ADMIN_ORG_NAME` replaced by `ALLOWED_ORGS` (comma-separated, required). Used for both slash command authorization and admin panel access.
- `main.go` fully wired: webhook, API, auth, and admin routes all registered with appropriate middleware

## 2026-04-11 — Project scaffold, database migrations, webhook ingestion, /log handler

### Added
- **Project structure**: Go module `github.com/mwesterweel/billbird` with `cmd/billbird`, `internal/` packages (webhook, commands, timeentry, client, github, api, admin, auth, config, db, cycletime)
- **Configuration** (`internal/config`): Environment-variable-based config with fail-fast validation for required vars (DATABASE_URL, GITHUB_APP_ID, GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY, GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET)
- **Database migrations** (6 migrations): clients, label_mappings, time_entries, cycle_time_records, webhook_deliveries, sessions — using `golang-migrate`
- **Database connection** (`internal/db`): pgxpool connection setup + auto-migration on startup
- **Webhook ingestion** (`internal/webhook`): HMAC-SHA256 signature verification, event routing by X-GitHub-Event header, idempotent delivery tracking via X-GitHub-Delivery
- **Slash command parser** (`internal/commands`): Parses `/log`, `/correct`, `/delete` from issue comments with duration support (h, m, combined) and optional descriptions — 16 unit tests, all passing
- **GitHub API client** (`internal/github`): GitHub App JWT authentication, installation token caching, post-comment, get-issue-labels
- **Time entry store** (`internal/timeentry`): Create, FindLatestActive, Supersede, SoftDelete — non-destructive correction chain
- **Client attribution** (`internal/client`): Label-to-client resolver with repo-specific precedence over global mappings
- **Command handlers**: Full `/log`, `/correct`, `/delete` flow with confirmation comments posted back to GitHub issues
- **Health check**: `GET /healthz` endpoint with database connectivity check
- **Docker**: Multi-stage Dockerfile (Go build → Alpine runtime, non-root user), docker-compose.yml with Postgres
- **OpenSpec**: Initialized with `billbird-v1` change — proposal, design, specs (7 capabilities), tasks (13 groups)

- **Documentation** (`docs/`): Setup guide, commands reference, client attribution, corrections, architecture, configuration, self-hosting, contributing
- **README**: Project overview with simplest use case, quick start, and doc links

### Architecture decisions recorded
- API-first: REST API is the primary interface, HTMX admin panel is a thin consumer (POC), Nextcloud app is the next consumer (MVP)
- UTC-only timestamps, optional timezone on user profile for display
- GitHub Projects V2: supplementary GraphQL query for column name resolution
- Admin access v1: org membership sufficient, no role-based access
